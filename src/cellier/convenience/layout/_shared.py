# ── Appearance controls: the toolkit-neutral decision layer ──────────────────
#
# Design section 7.3.  Which controls a panel contains, in what order, seeded
# with what values, is one question with one answer -- it was previously
# answered twice, once per toolkit, in ~110 near-identical lines each
# (section 4.2).  These two functions are that answer, as pure data: no
# controller, no widgets, no toolkit import, so the whole decision layer is
# unit-testable with no fixtures.  Each renderer keeps only a dispatch table
# mapping ``ControlSpec.kind`` to its own widget class.

    """One control to build, described without reference to any toolkit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kind : str
        Which control to build: ``color_map``, ``clim``, ``render``,
        ``lod_bias``, ``aabb``, ``loading``, ``loading_config`` or
        ``dataset_info``.  A renderer with no
        builder for a kind skips it.
    title : str
        What the control is called, e.g. ``"Contrast limits"``.  Both front
        ends pass it to the widget, which draws it itself -- as a label beside
        a single control, or as a heading over a block of rows
        (``plans/label_ownership_unification.md``).
    values : dict[str, object]
        Construction keywords for the widget, already read off the model.
