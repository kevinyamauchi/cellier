"""Which widget classes a toolkit provides (the ``GuiBackend`` seam).

A *backend* answers "which widget class serves this control"; a *host*
(:mod:`cellier.convenience._hosts`) answers "how are widgets composed and
presented".  The split is what lets one anywidget backend serve two hosts,
Jupyter and marimo, and it is what lets the layout walk in
:mod:`cellier.convenience.layout._walk` be written once
(``plans/gui_backend_seam.md``).

Deliberately **not** a registry.  There are exactly two backends, named here
and looked up through :func:`backend_for`; a third would be three more lines,
and designing a plugin interface from two similar cases would bake in
assumptions neither has tested.

Not every ``gui`` value has a backend: ``gui="offscreen"`` is headless capture
with no widgets at all, and :func:`backend_for` refuses it by name rather than
failing on a missing key.
