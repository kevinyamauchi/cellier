    Parameters
    ----------
    ortho : OrthoViewer
        The orthoviewer whose four scenes are attached.

    gui : "qt", "anywidget", or None
        Defaults to ``ortho.gui``; raises if it conflicts with it.
    fov : float
        Vertical field of view in degrees for the 3D camera.

        ``(near, far)`` clip distances for the 3D / 2D cameras.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
