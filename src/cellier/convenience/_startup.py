"""Observable state for a viewer's startup sequence.

Showing a viewer is not one step but four: the canvas has to reach the browser
or the screen, render a frame, load its data, and commit it.  Until now the
only thing a caller could observe was the happy ending -- ``on_ready`` fired
once everything had worked, and nothing at all fired when it had not.  A
viewer that never finished starting looked exactly like one still working.

This module makes the sequence answerable.  `StartupTracker` records
where each scene has got to, so ``viewer.startup_state`` can be *read* at any
moment with no callback, no event loop and no front end -- which is what makes
a blank panel diagnosable from a notebook cell instead of from a debugger.
