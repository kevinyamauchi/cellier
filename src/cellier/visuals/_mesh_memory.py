class MeshSectionConfig(EventedModel):
    """How a mesh is drawn in a 2D view: its cross-section.

    A 2D view cuts the mesh with the slice plane and draws the cut: an
    **outline** where the surface crosses the plane, and a **fill** where
    the outline closes into loops.  Both use the mesh's appearance (colour,
    opacity).  An open surface has no closed loop, so it draws its outline
    only.  A 3D view is not affected.

    Only spatial, continuous axes are cut.  Along any other sliced axis (a
    time axis, a discrete axis) the mesh is filtered face by face, as in 3D.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode : {"cut", "slab"}
        ``"cut"`` (default) draws the cut by the slice plane itself; the
        scene's thickness on the cut axis is ignored, so a thick slab that
        shows many image planes still shows one mesh outline.  ``"slab"``
        draws what lies inside the scene's slab: the surface between its two
        faces, flattened, with a cap at each face and both cuts as the
        outline.  With no thickness the two are the same.
    outline : bool
        Draw the outline.  Default ``True``.
    fill : bool
        Draw the fill.  Default ``True``.
    outline_width : float
        Outline thickness in screen pixels.  Default 2.

    Changing ``mode``, ``outline`` or ``fill`` reads the mesh again;
    ``outline_width`` applies at once.
