"""Opacity control for any visual (anywidget).

Layer 3 of the three-layer design in ``plans/convenience_cleanup.md`` section
10.2: each class is a field name, a label, and the per-field defaults.  All
behaviour -- the bus contract, the echo filter, the fan-out over an
``OrthoViewer``'s panel group -- lives in the layer-1 base, and the control
itself in the layer-2 type.
