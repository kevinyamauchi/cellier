"""Releasing anywidget controls when a view goes away.

``ipywidgets`` registers every ``Widget`` in a **process-global** table at
construction and only ``Widget.close()`` removes it, so a widget that is merely
dropped stays alive -- holding its traits, its synced ``_esm``/``_css`` source
text, and every object it subscribed to -- for the lifetime of the kernel.  In
a notebook that means building a viewer, closing it, and building another
leaves the first one's controls behind, every time.

``Widget.close()`` alone is not enough, because a ``DOMWidget`` constructs
auxiliary widgets of its own -- ``layout``, and ``style`` where it has one --
which are registered the same way and are **not** closed with their owner.
Closing a viewer with a dozen controls therefore left a dozen ``Layout``
widgets behind even when every control was closed correctly.

Every cellier anywidget's ``close()`` goes through :func:`close_aux_widgets`
for that reason.  ``Widget.close()`` is idempotent (it no-ops once the comm is
gone), so a widget reachable by more than one teardown path -- a control that
is both a tracked leaf and a child of a container, say -- is safe to close
twice.
