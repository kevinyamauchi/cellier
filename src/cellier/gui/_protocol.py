"""Backend-agnostic structural contract for cellier GUI elements.

The controller talks to widgets through one structural contract (see design doc
section 6.1).  It imposes no base class and says nothing about granularity: a
widget may carry one field or many.  ``CellierController.connect_widget`` wires
its single ``changed`` / ``closed`` pair and its aggregated
``subscription_specs()`` regardless, which is what lets the Qt backend stay
fine-grained (per-control widgets) while the anywidget backend uses a single
composite panel.
