"""What the render-settings panels contain, described once for both toolkits.

The Qt panels and the anywidget panels draw the same controls over the same
render-config fields, and the labels, ranges and explanations are the part
most likely to drift between two hand-written copies.  They live here
instead, as data, so a change lands in both front ends at once and
``test_render_controls_parity`` can check that neither has quietly grown a
control the other lacks.

What is **not** here is anything a spec cannot express: the occlusion
panel's auto/explicit radius coupling, its effective-radius readout, and
the temporal panel's convergence readout and reset button.  Those are
per-toolkit code in the panels themselves, because they are behaviour
rather than a field with a range.

Every ``field`` here must be settable through
``CellierController.update_render_config_field``; a control over a field
with no route looks like it works and raises when touched.  The parity test
checks that too.
