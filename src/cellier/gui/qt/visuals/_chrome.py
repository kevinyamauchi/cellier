"""How a Qt appearance control shows its own name.

A control names itself; whatever lays it out only stacks
(``plans/label_ownership_unification.md``).  The two shapes a name takes are
here so that both the single-field base (``_base.QtAppearanceField``) and the
hand-written multi-control widgets draw them the same way, and so the anywidget
front end has one thing to mirror rather than five:

* :func:`labelled_row` -- a single control, named by a label beside it.  The
  Qt twin of the anywidget ``.cellier-app-row``.
* :func:`titled_group` -- several rows that only mean something together (the
  bounding box, the volume-render block), named by a frame around them.  Qt
  has a first-class widget for this and the anywidget side draws a heading;
  that is the one place the two front ends deliberately differ, because a
  ``QGroupBox`` frame is the Qt idiom for exactly this.

Nothing here talks to the bus or knows what a visual is.

The Qt twin of the anywidget ``.cellier-app-row`` class.  It is what lets a
caller -- notably the visual-acceptance helper
``tests/convenience/_qt_acceptance.control_labels`` -- tell "this widget names
itself" from "this widget is named by a frame around it", without importing a
Qt class or matching on label text.

The row's **first layout item is its label**; that is the invariant readers
rely on to recover a control's name from the widget tree alone.

Mirrors ``.cellier-app-label { min-width: 5.5em }``.  Each control is its own
top-level widget in the dock's column, so nothing aligns them for free -- a
``QFormLayout`` per widget would align a widget with itself and no more.  A
shared minimum width in em is what actually lines up "Size" with "Edge
thickness space" down a panel, and it tracks the user's font the way the CSS
does.
