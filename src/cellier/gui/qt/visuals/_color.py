"""Uniform-colour control, shared by mesh, points and lines (Qt).

Layer 3 of the three-layer design in ``plans/convenience_cleanup.md`` section
10.2: each class is a field name, a label, and the per-field defaults.  All
behaviour -- the bus contract, the echo filter, the fan-out over an
``OrthoViewer``'s panel group -- lives in the layer-1 base, and the control
itself in the layer-2 type.

    One class for mesh, points and lines: they spell the field
    ``color`` alike, so the control is shared rather than
    triplicated.  Only used when the visual's ``color_mode`` is
    ``"uniform"``; per-vertex colours come from the data store.

        UUID of the visual, or a sequence of UUIDs to drive as one
