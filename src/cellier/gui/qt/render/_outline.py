class QtOutlineControls(QtRenderConfigPanel):
    """Screen-space outline settings on the cellier bus.

    Two layers run in the same fragment invocation and can both be active:
    *boundaries* draws every outlined region, *selection* draws only the
    regions carrying a palette slot.

    Every control here comes from the shared spec in
    ``cellier.gui._render_controls``, which is also what the notebook panel
    reads -- including the absence of a colour control on the selection
    layer, whose colour comes from the palette slot rather than from its
    own field.

    Which visuals are outlined, and in which slot, is a per-visual setting
    rather than a render-config one; see
    ``CellierController.set_visual_outline`` and ``set_label_selection``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config :
        The live ``OutlineConfig`` to read initial values from -- typically
        ``controller.render_config.outline``.
    parent :
        Optional Qt parent widget.
    slot_usage :
        Zero-argument callable returning ``{slot: how many visuals use it}``,
        annotating the palette swatches.  Derived state -- a visual moving
        between slots changes it with no config field changing -- so it is a
        callable rather than a value.  ``None`` draws no annotation.
