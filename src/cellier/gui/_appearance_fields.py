"""Toolkit-neutral description of a single appearance field.

Both toolkits' appearance-field widgets (``cellier.gui.qt.visuals._base`` and
``cellier.gui.anywidget.visuals._base``) need the same three answers about the
field they drive: what it is called, what to label it, and which bus event
carries a change to it back from the model.  The first two are trivial; the
third is not uniform, which is the whole reason this module exists.

``Controller._make_appearance_handler`` routes ``visible`` to
``VisualVisibilityChangedEvent`` (payload ``visible``) and every other
appearance field to ``AppearanceChangedEvent`` (payload ``field_name`` /
``new_value``).  A widget base that assumed one event type would work for 23 of
the 24 fields and silently never update for ``visible``.  Keeping the exception
here means the per-field widget classes stay a few lines each and neither
toolkit has to know about it.
