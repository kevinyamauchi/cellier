    slab, a viewport crop or an oblique plane, and it is pulled back through
    each visual's own transform rather than compared against data coordinates
    as though it were already in them.  The editable positions are still on
    ``cellier.scene.dims.AxisAlignedSelection``, which is what the sliders
    write to and what the region is built from.
