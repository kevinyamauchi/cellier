"""The one rule mapping a base LUT cell to the level-k brick that owns it.

A multiscale LUT is a grid of *base cells*, one per finest-level brick (or
tile, in 2D).  Coarser levels are written into it, and a shader reads it back.
Both sides must agree on which level-k brick owns each base cell.  On a
pyramid whose level ratio is not an integer -- 389 voxels halved to 194 is a
ratio of 2.005 -- no whole number of base cells matches a level-k brick
exactly, so the answer has to be *chosen*, once, and used everywhere::

    span = max(1, round_half_up(scale))  # base cells per level-k brick
    bricks = ceil(level_shape / block_size)  # level-k brick count
    brick = min(cell // span, bricks - 1)  # the last brick owns the tail

Python writes the LUT with it and uploads ``span`` and ``bricks`` so the
shaders compute the same integer answer (``cellier.brick_rule.wgsl`` and
``cellier.tile_rule.wgsl``).  Positions *inside* a brick still use the float
scale, so geometry stays exact; the price is that a sample can land slightly
outside the brick that owns its cell and read that brick's padding.
:func:`max_out_of_brick` measures how far, and :func:`brick_rule_issues`
reports levels where that exceeds the padding.
