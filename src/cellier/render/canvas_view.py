class CanvasView:
    """Owns one rendered canvas: widget, renderer, camera, and controller.

    Responsible for rendering one scene from one camera viewpoint.
    ``CanvasView`` does not hold a direct reference to the scene graph;
    instead it receives a ``get_scene_fn`` callable that is invoked each
    frame so ownership of the scene stays with ``SceneManager``.

    Camera change detection is implemented by comparing a cached
    ``CameraState`` snapshot each frame in ``_draw_frame``.  The
    ``_applying_model_state`` flag suppresses detection during
    programmatic camera updates to prevent feedback loops.

    The view drives its pygfx camera controllers itself
    (``auto_update=False``): each frame it ticks the active controller and
    applies the state it returns, **before** the comparison.  A moved camera
    is therefore detected in the frame that draws it, and whether the
    controller is still driving the camera (a drag held, its damped tail, a
    wheel or key animation) is known through public pygfx API.  Changes of
    that answer are reported as ``_CameraControllerEvent``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    camera_moving : bool
        Whether this canvas's camera is in motion, set by the controller's
        camera tracker through ``RenderManager.set_camera_moving``.  Read by
        per-frame draw choices (a visual that draws coarse during motion).

    Parameters
    ----------
    canvas_id : UUID
        Unique identifier for this canvas.
    scene_id : UUID
        ID of the scene this canvas renders.
    get_scene_fn : Callable[[UUID], gfx.Scene]
        Called each frame to retrieve the current scene.  Provided by
        ``RenderManager`` at construction time.
    dim : str
        Scene dimensionality: ``"2d"`` or ``"3d"``.  Controls which
        camera type and interaction controller are used.
    parent : QWidget or None
        Parent widget for the underlying ``QRenderWidget``.
    fov : float
        Vertical field of view in degrees (3D perspective only).
    depth_range : tuple[float, float]
        Near and far clip distances ``(near, far)``.
    outline_enabled : bool
        When ``True``, install a blender carrying the ``outline_id`` render
        target so label outlines have a per-pixel label key.  Costs 4 bytes
        per pixel.  Deciding here is the cheap path, not the only one:
        :meth:`ensure_render_targets` adds it later for the price of one
        recompile frame.
    ambient_occlusion_enabled : bool
        When ``True``, install a blender carrying the ``normal`` render
        target so cellier's volume shaders can hand the ambient occlusion
        pass a real surface normal instead of one reconstructed from
        depth.  Costs 8 bytes per pixel, and is addable later by the same
        route as *outline_enabled*.
