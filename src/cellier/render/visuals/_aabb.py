"""Axis-aligned bounding-box wireframes for the geometry visuals.

The image and label visuals build their box from a known array *shape*, which
they can do at construction and refresh once on first data.  A mesh, points,
lines or graph visual has no shape -- its extent is whatever vertices arrived
-- so the box has to be recomputed from the committed geometry each time.
That is the only real difference, and it is why these helpers exist rather
than the image path being reused directly.

The line is added as a **child of the data node**, so it inherits that node's
transform for free and is hidden along with it when ``visible`` goes False.
Its positions come from ``get_geometry_bounding_box()``, which reads the
node's own geometry and ignores its children -- without that the box would
measure itself and grow on every refresh.
