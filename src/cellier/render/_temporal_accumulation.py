"""Temporal accumulation effect pass for noise reduction in volume rendering.

Blends successive jittered frames via exponential moving average (EMA).
When the camera is still, noise decreases by ~sqrt(N) after N frames.
When the content or the camera changes, the history is stale: call
``reset()`` to discard it and restart.  ``CanvasView`` owns both triggers
(see ``CanvasView.invalidate_accumulation``).

    Insert as the first entry in ``renderer.effect_passes`` so it
    operates on the raw raymarched output before anti-aliasing.

    The history is kept in ``rgba16float`` rather than in the format of
    the incoming color texture.  pygfx renders effect passes into
    ``rgba8unorm_srgb`` (see its ``blender.py``, which carries a
    ``TODO: use half-floats`` of its own), and an EMA in 8 bits does not
    converge: one blend step moves a stored value by roughly
    ``alpha * (current - history)`` code values, so any difference under
    ``0.5 / alpha`` code values rounds away to nothing and the history
    freezes there permanently.  At the default ``alpha`` of 0.1 that
    floor is 4/255 -- a plainly visible ghost that no number of further
    frames can clear.  A float history removes the floor, so a stale
    image decays continuously to zero at every ``alpha``.  It also puts
    the average in linear space, which is where it belongs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
        Minimum blend weight for the current frame.  During warm-up the
        weight is ``1 / (frame_count + 1)``; once that falls below
        ``alpha`` the weight clamps to ``alpha``.  Lower values give
        smoother steady-state but slower convergence.  Default 0.1
        (steady state reached in ~10 still frames).
