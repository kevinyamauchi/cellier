"""The coordinate systems a render visual places its geometry with.

Today a node matrix is ``visual.transform.select_axes(displayed_axes)``
followed by an axis reversal.  ``select_axes`` extracts a square sub-block,
which is only correct when the linear block is block-diagonal with respect to
the displayed set, and on an unequal-rank transform it does not even raise --
it reads the homogeneous row and returns a plausible wrong matrix (design 3.8
finding 2).

The correct derivation composes three transforms (design 3.9):

    visual -> data   the collapsed voxel indices and the window origin
    data -> world    the visual's own transform
    world -> rendered  the inverse of the canvas embedding

and only the ``(z, y, x) -> (x, y, z)`` reversal at the end survives from the
old path.  :class:`RenderSpaces` is the bundle of systems that composition
needs, built by the controller (which owns all of them) and handed to each
render visual.

    Cellier order is ``(z, y, x)`` for 3D and ``(y, x)`` for 2D; pygfx uses

    """Snap positions on **discrete** data axes to the nearest sample.

    **Why a geometry visual needs this at all.**  An image resolves a slice
    position by *snapping to the nearest sample* -- that is what
    ``round_world_to_voxel`` does -- while a geometry visual resolves it by
    *containment in a window*.  Those two flip at different instants: a snap
    flips at the midpoint between two samples, a window flips when the
    position reaches the sample.  With both sharing one world axis, the
    markers visibly lag the image by up to half a sampling interval, and the
    lag is worst exactly where the sampling is coarsest.

    Widening the window cannot fix it: the tolerance required is half the
    *local* gap, which on an irregularly sampled axis is the one thing that
    varies.  Snapping the window's anchor does fix it, exactly, because it
    reuses the same rule -- round half up -- that the image already applies.

    Only axes declared ``sampling="discrete"`` are touched, so a store whose
    time column holds genuine continuous measurements keeps pure containment
    semantics.  A non-finite position is left alone: it means the transform
    reported no preimage, which the caller handles.

    **Rounding is confined to the samples that exist.**  The position handed
    in has already been clamped into the transform's domain by the interval
    semantics of ``imap_bounding_box``, but rounding can push it back out:
    the last sample's cell ends half a unit past its centre, and round-half-up
    sends that boundary *upward*, to a sample one past the end.  Mapping that
    index forward again then has no answer.  So the snapped value is confined
    to the whole samples inside :meth:`BaseTransform.input_domain`.

    This is emphatically **not** "pin an out-of-range position to the edge" --
    that decision was made one layer up and is not revisited here.  It is
    only that rounding must land on a sample that exists.

    re-showing its 9 s frame at 10, 11 and 12 s as though it were data.
    Skipping the request leaves the visual empty instead.

    Both arguments are in the visual's own **data** coordinates, which is
    what keeps this honest: the positions come from
    :func:`data_slice_positions`, which has already pulled the world
    selection back through this visual's own transform, and the extents come
    from its store.  Nothing here maps anything, so there is no opportunity
    to compare a world number against a data one -- the defect this whole
    design exists to prevent.

    Only **collapsed** axes are checked, because those are the only ones
    ``data_slice_positions`` returns: a displayed axis is a range the camera
    looks at, not a position, and a visual partly off-screen still draws the

    """World units per data unit, keyed by **data** axis.

    Read off the single entry each data axis contributes, which is what an
    axis-aligned transform has (see :func:`axis_correspondence`).  Used to
    convert a thickness stated in world units into the data units a store's
    own slab arithmetic works in.

    **Stays `AffineTransform`-only, deliberately.**  On a non-uniform axis
    there is no single world-units-per-data-unit -- the spacing is what
    varies -- so this function has no answer to give and must not pretend to
    by returning some average.  A caller that needs to convert a world
    window on a possibly-non-affine axis pulls the window's two **endpoints**
    back through the transform instead of dividing its width; that is exact
    for a monotonic axis and algebraically identical to dividing by the
    scale on an affine one.  See ``render/visuals/_graph_memory.py``, which
    is the only caller that ever needed it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_to_world : AffineTransform
        The visual's transform.  Affine specifically, not ``BaseTransform``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[int, float]
        Data axis to the magnitude of its scale.  Axes that reach no world
        axis are absent.

    the graph, whose trail is an asymmetric window with a fade measured from
    the slice (design 3.12's "per-family policy on top of the region").  They
    need the position, not the extent, so this returns the centre of the
    pulled-back region on every axis it bounds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    region : ConvexRegion
        The selection's region, in world coordinates.
    data_to_world : AffineTransform
        The visual's transform.
    world : WorldCoordinateSystem
        Its output system, needed to resolve ``broadcast_axes``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[int, float]
        Data axis to slice position.  Axes the region leaves unbounded are
        absent.

    Raises
    ------
