class SubscriberInfo:
    """Human-readable summary of one EventBus subscription.

    Returned by `EventBus.get_subscribers`.  Intended for
    interactive debugging and test assertions — not for production
    control flow.

    Attributes
    ----------
    callback_qualname : str
        Dotted qualified name of the registered callback, e.g.
        ``"MyPanel.on_dims_changed"``.  Reads ``"(dead)"``
        when the callback was held by a weak reference that has since
        been garbage-collected.
    callback_instance : object
        The bound object when the callback is a bound method; ``None``
        for plain functions or dead weak references.  In a debugger,
        inspect this to examine the live subscriber.
    owner_id : UUID or None
        UUID used to group this subscription for bulk removal via
        `EventBus.unsubscribe_all`.  Typically the id of the owning
        widget, or of the controller for its own subscriptions.
    entity_id : UUID or None
        The entity this subscription is scoped to, or ``None`` when
        the subscription receives events for all entities of that
        type.  See `EventBus.get_subscribers` for a full
        explanation of what constitutes an entity.
    is_weak : bool
        ``True`` when the bus holds only a weak reference to the
        callback, meaning the subscriber may be garbage-collected
        without explicit teardown.
    is_alive : bool
        ``True`` when the callback target is still reachable.  Always
        ``True`` for strong references; may become ``False`` for weak
        ones after the subscriber is garbage-collected.

    """One subscription, returned by every ``on_*`` method.

    Call ``unsubscribe()`` to stop the callback.  The handle needs nothing
    else: it finds its own event bus, so code that keeps a handle does not
    also have to keep the controller or viewer that made it.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> handle = viewer.on_pick(canvas_id, ImagePickEvent, show_value)
    >>> handle.active
    True
    >>> handle.unsubscribe()  # no more calls to show_value
    >>> handle.active

    >>> handle = controller.on_dims_changed(scene_id, first_change, owner_id=me)

    Notes
    -----
    The handle holds only a weak reference to its bus, so a handle kept after
    the controller is gone does not keep the controller alive; it then reads

        """Return a summary of every subscription registered for *event_type*.

        Intended for interactive debugging and introspection.  Do not
        use in production control flow.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event_type :
            The event class to query, e.g. ``DimsChangedEvent``.
        entity_id :
            Scope the results to subscriptions that would fire when an
            event targets this specific entity UUID.  Pass ``None``
            (the default) to return every subscription for
            *event_type* regardless of scope.

            **What is an entity?**

            Each event type is associated with exactly one model-layer
            object whose UUID acts as the routing key — the *entity*.
            The full mapping is:

            - Scene (keyed by ``scene_id``) — ``DimsChangedEvent``,
              ``CameraChangedEvent``, ``ResliceStartedEvent``,
              ``VisualAddedEvent``, ``VisualRemovedEvent``,
              ``SceneAddedEvent``, ``SceneRemovedEvent``
            - Visual (keyed by ``visual_id``) —
              ``AppearanceChangedEvent``, ``AABBChangedEvent``,
              ``VisualVisibilityChangedEvent``,
              ``TransformChangedEvent``, ``ResliceCompletedEvent``,
              ``ResliceProgressEvent``, ``BackstopCompleteEvent``,
              ``LoadingConfigChangedEvent``,
              ``LodConfigChangedEvent``,
              ``ClippingPlanesChangedEvent``,
              ``RenderPlanesChangedEvent``,
              ``PlaneInteractionEvent``,
              ``TransformInteractionEvent``
            - Canvas (keyed by ``canvas_id``) — ``FrameRenderedEvent``,
              ``CanvasConnectedEvent``, ``CanvasSizeChangedEvent``,
              ``PlaneGizmoChangedEvent``
            - Data store (keyed by ``data_store_id``) —
              ``DataStoreMetadataChangedEvent``,
              ``DataStoreContentsChangedEvent``
            - Plane gizmo (keyed by ``gizmo_id``) —
              ``PlaneGizmoMovedEvent``

            Subscribing with ``entity_id=some_scene_id`` means the
            callback only fires for events whose ``scene_id`` matches.
            Subscribing with ``entity_id=None`` means the callback
            fires for every emission of that type.

            When this method receives *entity_id*, the results include
            both subscriptions scoped to that UUID **and** unscoped
            subscriptions (``entity_id=None``), because both would be
            called by the bus for that entity's events.

        Returns
        -------
        list[SubscriberInfo]
            One entry per matching subscription, in registration order.
