class BaseDataStore(EventedModel):
    """The base class for all DataStores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : UUID4
        The unique identifier for the data store.  When not given it is
        taken from the first entry of ``data_coordinate_systems`` (its
        ``datastore_id``), or generated when that is empty too.
    name : str
        The name of the data store.
    data_coordinate_systems : list[DataCoordinateSystem]
        The store's intrinsic (voxel) coordinate systems, one per resolution
        level, index ``0`` being the finest.  A single-resolution store has
        one entry.

        **Constructed by the caller.**  There is no shorthand: pass built
        ``DataCoordinateSystem`` objects.  Every system's ``datastore_id``
        must equal the store's ``id``, and a mismatch raises.  A caller
        building the system before the store exists gives it
        ``datastore_id=uuid4()`` and omits ``id``; the store adopts it.

        **Stored, not derived.**  Transforms serialize their endpoints as
        UUIDs, so a system rebuilt on load would mint fresh ids and every
        transform naming it would point at nothing.

        The default is an **empty list**: a store with no axis metadata does
        not invent one, because ``Axis.axis_type`` has no honest default.
        Concrete stores that can say -- the OME-Zarr readers -- populate it at
        construction.  A store that reaches ``CellierController.add_visual``
        still empty has one derived from the scene's world axes; see
        ``CellierController._ensure_data_coordinate_systems``.
    level_scales : list[tuple[float, ...]]
        Per-level, per-axis scale of level ``k`` voxels in level ``0`` voxels.
        ``level_scales[0]`` is all ones.  Empty for a single-level store.

        **This is where a pyramid's geometry is stated.**  The readers derive
        it from OME-NGFF metadata; it is raw numbers, which is all a store can
        know on its own.
    level_translations : list[tuple[float, ...]]
        The offset half of the same, in level-0 voxels.
        ``level_translations[0]`` is all zeros.
    level_transforms : list[AffineTransform]
        Level ``k`` voxel space -> level ``0`` voxel space, one per entry in
        ``data_coordinate_systems``.  Index ``0`` is the identity.  Empty
        alongside an empty ``data_coordinate_systems``.

        **Derived, not authored.**  Built from ``level_scales`` /
        ``level_translations`` by ``install_level_transforms`` as soon as the
        store has its coordinate systems -- at construction when they are
        passed, or from the scene's world.  It is stored rather than
        recomputed on read
        because a transform serializes its endpoints as ids, and a rebuilt
        one would name systems that no longer exist.

        The one number the world-extent of a visual is built from.  Every

        :func:`gridded_axis_extents` -- the **edge** convention,

        Geometry stores use :func:`geometry_axis_extents` -- the bounding
        box of their vertices, with no padding, because a vertex is a point.

        **Staleness is not defended against.**  A geometry store whose
        ``positions`` are reassigned may report an extent computed from the
