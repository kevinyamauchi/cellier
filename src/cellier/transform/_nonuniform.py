class AxisCoordinates(BaseModel):
    """The sample positions of one irregularly-spaced axis.

    ``values`` are the world positions of the sample **centres** -- one per
    data index -- and ``edges`` are the world positions of the axis's two
    outer **edges**.  That is exactly the centre-versus-edge distinction a
    data store already makes: a gridded axis of ``size`` voxels spans
    ``(-0.5, size - 0.5)`` because a voxel is centred on its index, and this
    class is the same statement for an axis whose spacing is irregular.

    Keeping ``edges`` explicit is what lets a non-uniform axis answer the
    question every store answers::

        world extent on an axis = transform.map(store.axis_extents)

    Mapping a store's extent means mapping data index ``-0.5``, which linear
    interpolation cannot extrapolate to from ``values`` alone.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : tuple[float, ...]
        World position of each sample centre, strictly increasing.  A tuple
        rather than an ndarray so that equality and hashing stay total --
        an ndarray field makes ``__eq__`` return an array, which degrades
        every containing model's comparison.
    edges : tuple[float, float] or None
        World position of the axis's outer edges.  ``None`` (the default)
        extrapolates by half the gap at each end, which is the choice that
        gives the first and last samples a **full** nearest-neighbour
        catchment rather than a half one.  The padding is naturally
        asymmetric when the first and last gaps differ.

        Must contain ``values``: ``edges[0] <= values[0]`` and
        ``edges[1] >= values[-1]``.  A narrower span would make samples
        unreachable, which is silent data loss; shorten ``values`` instead.

    Wraps ``Bijection(GridInterpolation, GridInterpolation)`` so the model
    satisfies :class:`~cellier.transform._base.BaseTransform`'s
    ``transform: Transform`` field and reports a ``1 -> 1`` dimensionality
    that ``validate_against`` can check.  The wrapped object is **not** what
    executes: the mapping is done here, because ``GridInterpolation.apply``
    allocates its output with ``zeros_like(coords)`` and so silently
    truncates an integer input array.

    **Out of range does not clamp.**  Outside the axis's span the result is
    ``nan`` -- there is no preimage, and a store has no data there.  Earlier
    revisions of the design clamped to the edge sample, which meant an
    acquisition ending at 9 s re-showed its 9 s frame at 10, 11 and 12 s as
    though it were data.  ``nan`` rather than an exception because a call
    maps a whole array and some of its points may be in range while others
    are not.

    **Point and interval queries differ deliberately.**
    :meth:`map_coordinates` / :meth:`imap_coordinates` are point queries and
    return ``nan`` outside the span.  :meth:`map_bounding_box` /
    :meth:`imap_bounding_box` are interval queries and **intersect** with the
    span, so an interval that merely overhangs an end comes back clipped
    rather than empty.  Both are correct: a slice position outside the data
    selects nothing, while a trail window reaching back past the first frame
    should still start at the first frame.  Do not "simplify" the two into
    one behaviour -- collapsing to point semantics makes every trail window
    vanish near the start of an axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : AxisCoordinates
        The sample centres and outer edges.
    interpolation : Literal["linear", "nearest"]
        How a position between samples is mapped.  Defaults to ``"linear"``,
        which is what makes this a continuous coordinate map.

        Note this differs from cellier's ``"nearest"`` default for *image
        sampling*, and deliberately: that convention is about choosing a
        sample to read, while this is about mapping a position.  The
        pipeline's nearest-ness is applied one layer up, by
        ``round_world_to_voxel`` -- and a linear inverse followed by that
        rounding is exactly nearest-neighbour in world units, verified
        across the whole domain.  Choosing ``"nearest"`` here instead snaps
        positions to sample centres, which also collapses the axis's extent
        onto ``(values[0], values[-1])``; that is self-consistent, but it is
        not the continuous map the slicing path expects.
