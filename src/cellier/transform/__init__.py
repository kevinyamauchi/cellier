"""Coordinate systems, and the transforms between them.

A transform here names the two coordinate systems it maps between, rather
than carrying only a matrix.  That is what lets the viewer refuse one built
against a look-alike pair of spaces, what makes a pyramid's per-level maps
compose without a downsampling assumption, and what a region needs in order
to be pulled back through anything at all.

Built alongside an earlier, unnamed transform layer under this same path --
the two were deliberately independent, neither importing from the other (D1)
-- and took the name over when that layer was retired in Phase 8 of the
integration.
