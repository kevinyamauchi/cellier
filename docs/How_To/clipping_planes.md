# Clip a visual with planes

A clipping plane hides the part of a visual on one side of it. Every visual
type takes them: images and labels (in memory or multiscale), meshes,
points, lines and graphs. Each visual has its own planes; there are no
scene-wide ones.

## The short version

```python
from cellier.visuals import ClippingPlane

system = store.data_coordinate_systems[0]
plane = ClippingPlane.from_point_normal(
    system, point=(0, 0, 100), normal=(0, 0, 1), axes=("z", "y", "x")
)
visual = viewer.add_image(store, clipping_planes=(plane,))
```

The visual is drawn where `normal . p >= normal . point`: the side the
normal points to. Here that is `x >= 100`.

## Store first, then planes, then the visual

A plane is written in the **level-0 data coordinates** of the store the
visual reads, so the store comes first and the plane is built from its
coordinate system.

```python
store = OMEZarrImageDataStore.from_path(uri)          # has its system
# or
store = ImageMemoryStore(data=array, data_coordinate_systems=[system])

plane = ClippingPlane.from_point_normal(store.data_coordinate_systems[0], ...)
visual = viewer.add_image(store, clipping_planes=(plane,))
```

A store built with no coordinate system takes the scene's axes when its
first visual is added. It has nothing to build a plane from before that, so
add the visual and then assign the planes:

```python
visual = viewer.add_points(PointsMemoryStore(positions=positions))
visual.clipping_planes = (
    ClippingPlane.from_point_normal(store.data_coordinate_systems[0], ...),
)
```

A plane belongs to one store object. Opening the same file twice gives two
stores with two coordinate systems, and a plane built for one is refused by
a visual of the other. Saving and loading a viewer keeps the planes.

## Units and direction

- **Data units.** Voxels for an image; the positions' own units for a mesh
  or points. Not world units.
- **The normal is not a direction in the sample when voxels are not
  cubes.** It acts on voxel indices. With a z spacing four times the x
  spacing, a plane tilted 45 degrees in the sample has a normal of
  `(1, 0, 4)` over `(z, y, x)`, not `(1, 0, 1)`.
- The normal need not be unit length.

## Planes on some axes only

`axes=` names the axes `point` and `normal` are given on. The other axes are
not constrained, so a `zyx` plane on `tczyx` data cuts every timepoint and
every channel in the same place:

```python
ClippingPlane.from_point_normal(
    system, point=(40, 0, 0), normal=(1, 0, 0), axes=("z", "y", "x")
)
```

Any axis may carry a component. A plane with a component on `t` moves as the
time slider moves. On a composite image, a plane with a component on the
channel axis cuts each channel in a different place.

## Several planes

A visual keeps the **intersection**: what is on the kept side of every
enabled plane. Two opposed planes keep a slab; six keep a box.

```python
visual.clipping_planes = (left, right)
```

## Changing planes

Planes are frozen. Assign a new tuple; one assignment is one event.

```python
visual.clipping_planes = (moved,)                       # move
visual.clipping_planes = (*visual.clipping_planes, new) # add
visual.clipping_planes = ()                             # remove all
```

`enabled=False` keeps a plane in the list without clipping. Switching it on
and off is free. Adding or removing a plane changes the number of planes,
which compiles a shader the first time that number is used (a short hitch,
once).

`controller.set_clipping_planes(visual_id, planes, source_id=...)` does the
same with a `source_id` on the resulting `ClippingPlanesChangedEvent`.

## What a cut looks like

| Visual | In a 3D view | In a 2D view |
|---|---|---|
| Image, MIP | The projection of the kept part | The slice, cut at a line |
| Image, ISO; labels | A solid face on the plane, lit with the plane's normal | The slice, cut at a line |
| Mesh | An open (hollow) cut | Its section, cut at a line |
| Lines, graph edges | Cut at the plane | Cut at the plane |
| Points, graph nodes | Whole markers, kept or dropped by their centre | The same |

In a 2D view the plane is the line where it meets the slice, and the line
moves with the slider. Geometry drawn through a slab thicker than zero is
clipped by where it really is, not by where it lands on the slice.

The bounding-box wireframe and overlays are not clipped. Camera fit uses the
whole data, not the kept part.

## What it costs

- Moving a plane does not reload a mesh, points or an in-memory image in 3D:
  it is a uniform update.
- A multiscale image or label volume plans again, and does not fetch bricks
  or tiles that are wholly clipped. The budget that frees goes to the part
  that is kept.
- Geometry in a 2D slab is read again on each move, because the read does
  the clipping there. A large mesh keeps its last picture on screen until
  the new one is ready.

## Picking and painting

A clipped part cannot be picked. The paint brush writes only voxels on the
kept side.

## The control

Every controls config takes `clipping_controls=True`:

```python
viewer.add_image(
    store,
    controls=InMemoryImageControlsConfig(appearance=True, clipping_controls=True),
)
```

The "Clipping planes" group has a row per plane: on or off, a flip button,
a remove button, the normal, and a position slider along the normal. In an
`OrthoViewer` a visual's planes are shared by its four panels.

The normal has one column per data axis, in the same order as the entries
of `normal`. The axis names come from the store's data coordinate system
(`store.data_coordinate_systems[0]`). For an axis named `z`, the column has:

- a `+z` and a `-z` button. They face the plane along that axis and keep the
  side toward higher (`+z`) or lower (`-z`) values. The plane turns in place.
- under them, the normal's entry on that axis, for an oblique plane. Only the direction
  of the normal matters; the entries are not rescaled as you type.

The position slider's range is the data's bounding box along the normal, and
follows the store when its extent changes.

The anywidget control still has the earlier layout: a list of axes (or
`custom`) and a typed normal.

visuals, `examples/clipping_planes/multiscale_clipping_planes_viewer.py`.
