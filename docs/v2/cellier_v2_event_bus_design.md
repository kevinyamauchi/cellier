# Cellier v2 EventBus — Design Document

## Overview

The v2 EventBus is the sole communication channel between the model layer (psygnal
`EventedModel` instances held by the controller) and the render layer (`RenderManager`,
`CanvasView`, `GFX*Visual`). No model class ever imports a render-layer class. No
render-layer class ever imports a model class. Every cross-layer communication passes
through a typed event on the bus.

The bus is an internal implementation detail. Application developers never hold a
reference to it. External state change notifications are surfaced through the
`controller.on_*` callback registration methods.

This document covers: the shared state NamedTuples, the event catalogue, the bus API,
bounce-back prevention, the ContextVar source-ID pattern, async handler conventions,
how the controller bridges psygnal signals to bus events, and the registration lifecycle.

**GUI widgets import only from `cellier.v2.events`. No widget imports
`cellier.v2.controller`.**

Nothing outside `src/cellier/v2/` imports from this package. The controller is the only
production caller of `EventBus`.

---

## Widget integration

### The widget contract

Every reusable cellier widget that connects to the event bus must expose:

- `_id: UUID` — a stable UUID generated at construction (one per widget instance).
- `changed: Signal = Signal(object)` — psygnal signal emitted when the widget's value
  changes.  The payload is an `*UpdateEvent` (`AppearanceUpdateEvent`,
  `DimsUpdateEvent`, or `AABBUpdateEvent`).
- `closed: Signal = Signal()` — psygnal signal emitted when the widget closes, so the
  controller can clean up its bus subscriptions automatically.
- `subscription_specs() -> list[SubscriptionSpec]` — declares which bus events the
  widget wants to receive.  Returns an empty list for write-only widgets.

Widgets never import `cellier.v2.controller` and never hold a controller reference.
They are pure UI components that communicate only through signals and
`SubscriptionSpec` declarations.  This makes them distributable as reusable plugins
in separate packages that depend only on `cellier.v2.events`.

### `SubscriptionSpec`

```python
class SubscriptionSpec(NamedTuple):
    """One inbound event subscription declared by a cellier widget."""

    event_type: type
    handler: Callable[..., None]
    entity_id: UUID | None = None
    weak: bool = False
```

`SubscriptionSpec` lives in `src/cellier/v2/events/_update_events.py` and is
re-exported from `cellier.v2.events`.  Placing it in the `events` package means
widgets can import it without creating a circular dependency on any render-layer or
controller module.

### `CellierController.connect_widget`

```python
def connect_widget(
    self,
    widget: Any,
    *,
    subscription_specs: list[SubscriptionSpec] | None = None,
) -> None:
```

`connect_widget` does three things:

1. Connects `widget.changed → self._incoming_events.emit` so that `*UpdateEvent`
   payloads enter the controller's incoming-event pipeline.
2. Connects `widget.closed → self.unsubscribe_owner(widget._id)` so that bus
   subscriptions are cleaned up automatically when the widget closes.
3. Registers each `SubscriptionSpec` on the outgoing event bus with
   `owner_id=widget._id`.

Typical call site after construction:

```python
slider = QtClimRangeSlider(visual_id, clim_range=(0, 255), initial_clim=(0, 200))
controller.connect_widget(slider, subscription_specs=slider.subscription_specs())
```

Write-only widgets (no inbound subscriptions) omit `subscription_specs`:

```python
controller.connect_widget(my_button)
```

### Application code exception

Script-local closures and callbacks that live in the same file as the controller
instantiation may call `controller.incoming_events.emit()` directly rather than
wrapping themselves in the widget contract.  The widget contract exists to enable
reusable components distributed in separate packages.

---

## Design principles

### NamedTuples for all events and state snapshots

All events and shared state objects are `NamedTuple`s — immutable, fast, and consistent
with the project convention. Because Python `NamedTuple` subclasses cannot add fields,
there is no common base class with shared fields. Instead, every event NamedTuple
independently declares a `source_id: UUID` as its first field. The `CellierEventTypes`
Union alias at module level groups them for type annotations on the bus.

### One universal field: `source_id`

Every event carries a `source_id: UUID` identifying the object that triggered the
change. This is the primary mechanism for preventing feedback loops (see
§Bounce-back prevention and the ContextVar pattern). The bus itself is source-agnostic;
filtering on `source_id` is the subscriber's responsibility.

### No model references inside the bus

The bus is constructed before any model or render object exists. It holds no reference
to `ViewerModel`, `DimsManager`, or any psygnal object. The controller owns all the
callbacks that bridge psygnal signals to bus events (see §How the controller bridges
psygnal to the bus).

### Typed dispatch with optional entity filtering

Subscribers declare the event type they want, optionally scoped to a specific entity
(scene, visual, canvas, data store). New event types require no changes to the bus
class itself.

### Synchronous bus, async-safe handlers

All bus dispatch is synchronous. Handlers that need to await work wrap it in
`asyncio.create_task()` and return immediately. This is a documented convention, not
a constraint enforced by the bus.

### Strong references by default; weak references opt-in

Subscriptions hold strong references to callbacks by default. The controller's explicit
`unsubscribe_all(owner_id)` lifecycle is the primary cleanup mechanism and is sufficient
for all render-layer objects whose lifetimes the controller manages directly.

Weak references (`weak=True`) are a safety net for subscribers that may be
garbage-collected outside the controller's teardown path — for example, transient
widgets closed by Qt independently. When a weak subscription's target is collected,
the entry is cleaned up lazily on the next emission of that event type.

### Symmetric registration lifecycle

Every entity that is registered can be fully deregistered. All callback references and
entity filters are cleaned up atomically on deregistration via `unsubscribe_all()`.
Weak subscriptions are additionally cleaned up automatically when their target is
collected, without requiring any explicit call.

---

## Shared state NamedTuples

These are not events — they are the immutable state payloads that events carry. They
live in `src/cellier/v2/_state.py`. This module sits above both the events package and
the render layer so neither needs to import the other to reach shared types.

### `DimsState`

`DimsState` is a two-level structure. The top level carries `axis_labels` alongside a
`selection` object. The selection is typed as `SelectionState`, which is currently
either an `AxisAlignedSelectionState` (the only concrete implementation) or the stub
`PlaneSelectionState`.

```python
SelectionState = AxisAlignedSelectionState | PlaneSelectionState


class AxisAlignedSelectionState(NamedTuple):
    """Immutable snapshot of an axis-aligned slice selection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    displayed_axes :
        Indices of axes currently rendered, e.g. ``(0, 1, 2)`` for 3-D
        or ``(1, 2)`` for a 2-D XY slice.
    slice_indices :
        Mapping of axis index to the current integer slice position for
        each non-displayed axis.  Empty for a pure 3-D view.
    """

    displayed_axes: tuple[int, ...]
    slice_indices: dict[int, int]

    def to_index_selection(self, ndim: int) -> tuple[int | slice, ...]:
        """Return a per-axis numpy indexer in axis order.

        Displayed axes → ``slice(None)``, sliced axes → their int value.
        """
        ...


class DimsState(NamedTuple):
    """Current dimension display state for a scene.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis_labels :
        Ordered labels for every axis in the scene coordinate system,
        e.g. ``("z", "y", "x")``.
    selection :
        Immutable snapshot of which axes are displayed and the current
        slice position for all non-displayed axes.
    """

    axis_labels: tuple[str, ...]
    selection: SelectionState
```

Access patterns — accessing displayed axes and slice indices from a `DimsState`:

```python
# in a bus event handler
displayed = event.dims_state.selection.displayed_axes  # e.g. (0, 1, 2)
z_index   = event.dims_state.selection.slice_indices.get(0, 0)
```

### `CameraState`

Numpy-free immutable snapshot suitable for event payloads, external callbacks, and
serialization. Distinct from `ReslicingRequest`, which carries numpy arrays for the
hot slicing path.

```python
class CameraState(NamedTuple):
    """Immutable snapshot of the active camera's logical state.

    For perspective cameras: ``fov`` is populated; ``extent`` is
    ``(0.0, 0.0)``.
    For orthographic cameras: ``extent`` is populated; ``fov`` is
    ``0.0``.
    ``zoom`` applies to both types.

    Parameters
    ----------
    camera_type :
        ``"perspective"`` or ``"orthographic"``.
    position :
        World-space camera position ``(x, y, z)``.
    rotation :
        Camera orientation as a unit quaternion ``(x, y, z, w)``,
        matching pygfx's convention.
    up :
        World-space up vector ``(x, y, z)``.
    fov :
        Vertical field of view in degrees.  Perspective cameras only;
        ``0.0`` for orthographic.
    zoom :
        Unitless zoom multiplier.  Applies to both camera types.
    extent :
        ``(width, height)`` in world units.  Orthographic cameras only;
        ``(0.0, 0.0)`` for perspective.
    depth_range :
        ``(near, far)`` clip distances.
    """

    camera_type: Literal["perspective", "orthographic"]
    position: tuple[float, float, float]
    rotation: tuple[float, float, float, float]
    up: tuple[float, float, float]
    fov: float
    zoom: float
    extent: tuple[float, float]
    depth_range: tuple[float, float]
```

`CameraState` and `DimsState` are both defined in `src/cellier/v2/_state.py` and
re-exported from `cellier.v2.events` so subscribers have a single import location.

---

## Event catalogue

All events live in `src/cellier/v2/events/_events.py`. All are `NamedTuple`s. The
first field of every event is `source_id: UUID`.

### Scene / dims events

```python
class DimsChangedEvent(NamedTuple):
    """Fired when a scene's DimsManager state changes.

    Triggers: dims slider move, programmatic mutation of
    ``dims.selection.slice_indices``, ``dims.selection.displayed_axes``.

    Primary consumers:
    - ``SliceCoordinator``: invalidate stale 2D caches
    - Controller: reslice the affected scene
    - Dims slider widget: update slider position without re-emitting

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_id :
        UUID of the object that caused the change.  The dims slider
        widget passes its own ID via ``controller.update_slice_indices``
        so it can echo-filter the resulting event.
    scene_id :
        The scene whose ``DimsManager`` changed.
    dims_state :
        Full snapshot of the new dims state.
    displayed_axes_changed :
        ``True`` when ``displayed_axes`` changed, not just
        ``slice_indices``.  The controller uses this flag to rebuild
        visual geometry and switch canvas cameras.
    """

    source_id: UUID
    scene_id: UUID
    dims_state: DimsState
    displayed_axes_changed: bool
```

```python
class CameraChangedEvent(NamedTuple):
    """Fired when the camera moves in a scene.

    Source: ``CanvasView`` detects camera movement each frame by
    comparing a cached ``CameraState`` snapshot; it emits this event
    with ``source_id = canvas_id`` when the state changes.

    Primary consumers:
    - Controller: update camera model and schedule debounced reslice

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_id :
        ID of the canvas that moved the camera (its ``canvas_id``, not

### Visual / appearance events

```python
class AppearanceChangedEvent(NamedTuple):
    """Fired when any field on a visual's appearance model changes.

    Emitted by the controller's psygnal bridge whenever a field event
    fires on a ``BaseAppearance`` subclass.  ``visible`` field changes
    emit ``VisualVisibilityChangedEvent`` instead.

    - External ``on_visual_changed`` callbacks

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_id :
        UUID of the object that caused the change.  Widget-driven
        changes carry the widget's own ID (injected via the ContextVar

        fall back to the controller's ID.
    visual_id :
        The visual whose appearance changed.
    field_name :
        The name of the changed field, e.g. ``"clim"``.
    new_value :
        The new value.  Typed as ``Any``; consumers cast as needed.
    requires_reslice :
        ``True`` for fields that invalidate the current brick set
        (``lod_bias``, ``force_level``, ``frustum_cull``).
        ``False`` for pure GPU-side changes (``color_map``, ``clim``).

## EventBus API

### Internal subscription record: `_Subscription`

Subscriptions are stored as `_Subscription` instances rather than plain tuples.
Weak reference logic is fully encapsulated in this class — there is no standalone
`make_weak_callback` helper.

```python
class _Subscription:
    __slots__ = (
        "_strong_cb",   # callback (strong ref)
        "_weak_func",   # weakref to unbound function (weak bound methods or weak fns)
        "_weak_obj",    # weakref to bound instance (weak bound methods only)
        "entity_id",
        "handle",
        "is_weak",
        "owner_id",
    )

    def is_alive(self) -> bool:
        """Return True if the callback target is still reachable."""
        ...

    def call(self, event) -> None:
        """Invoke the callback. Assumes is_alive() is True."""
        ...

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        # Produces e.g.:
        # _Subscription(callback='QtDimsSliders._on_dims_changed'
        #   owner_id=3f2a... entity_id=9c1b... strong/alive)
        ...
```

### `SubscriberInfo` — debugging helper

`get_subscribers()` returns `SubscriberInfo` dataclass instances (not raw
`_Subscription` objects) for external inspection. See
[debugging_events.md](debugging_events.md) for usage.

```python
@dataclass
class SubscriberInfo:
    callback_qualname: str   # e.g. "QtDimsSliders._on_dims_changed"
    callback_instance: Any   # bound object, or None for plain functions
    owner_id: UUID | None
    entity_id: UUID | None
    is_weak: bool
    is_alive: bool
```

### `EventBus`

```python
class EventBus:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # event_type → list[_Subscription], in registration order
        self._subs: dict[type, list[_Subscription]] = defaultdict(list)

        # handle._id (UUID) → (event_type, _Subscription) for O(1) single removal
        self._handle_index: dict[UUID, tuple[type, _Subscription]] = {}
```

**Note on `unsubscribe_all` performance.** There is no forward owner index.
`unsubscribe_all(owner_id)` scans all subscriptions across all event types linearly.
This is O(n) in the total number of subscriptions. In practice the subscription count
is small (tens of entries) so this has no measurable cost.

```python
    def subscribe(
        self,
        event_type: type,
        callback: Callable,
        *,
        entity_id: UUID | None = None,
        owner_id: UUID | None = None,
        weak: bool = False,
    ) -> SubscriptionHandle:
        """Register callback to be called when event_type is emitted.

        owner_id :

            Opaque token for individual removal via ``unsubscribe()``.

        event_type: type,
        *,
        entity_id: UUID | None = None,
    ) -> list[SubscriberInfo]: ...
```

### Entity ID resolution

The bus resolves the "canonical entity ID" of an event for `entity_id` filtering using a
module-level mapping. Each event type declares which of its fields is the filterable
entity:

```python
_ENTITY_FIELD: dict[type, str] = {
    DimsChangedEvent:                  "scene_id",
    CameraChangedEvent:                "scene_id",
    AppearanceChangedEvent:            "visual_id",
    AABBChangedEvent:                  "visual_id",
    VisualVisibilityChangedEvent:      "visual_id",
    TransformChangedEvent:             "visual_id",
    DataStoreMetadataChangedEvent:     "data_store_id",
    DataStoreContentsChangedEvent:     "data_store_id",
    ResliceStartedEvent:               "scene_id",
    ResliceCompletedEvent:             "visual_id",
    ResliceCancelledEvent:             "visual_id",
    FrameRenderedEvent:                "canvas_id",
    VisualAddedEvent:                  "scene_id",
    VisualRemovedEvent:                "scene_id",
    SceneAddedEvent:                   "scene_id",
    SceneRemovedEvent:                 "scene_id",
}
```

## Bounce-back prevention and the ContextVar pattern

### The problem

Preventing feedback loops requires two things:

1. **Echo filtering** — a widget that drives a model change must be able to identify
   the resulting bus event as its own and ignore it, rather than redundantly
   re-applying the value it just set.

2. **Re-entrancy prevention** — when widget B is programmatically updated in response
   to a change, it must not re-broadcast that update back into the system.

Re-entrancy is handled at the widget level with Qt's `blockSignals(True/False)` around
every programmatic `setValue()` call. This prevents the widget's own `valueChanged`
signal from firing during a model-driven update.

Echo filtering requires that every bus event carry a `source_id` that identifies the
originating widget. Widgets check `if event.source_id == self._id: return` at the top
of their bus handlers.

### The challenge: psygnal does not carry caller metadata

Widgets do not emit bus events directly. Instead they mutate model fields through
controller methods, and a psygnal bridge handler fires synchronously to emit the bus
event. The bridge handler's signature only receives the new field value via
`EmissionInfo` — there is no mechanism within psygnal to pass the calling widget's UUID
down to the handler.

### The solution: ContextVar side-channel

A `contextvars.ContextVar` is set by the controller method before the model mutation
and reset after. The psygnal handler, running synchronously in the same call frame,
reads the var to retrieve the caller-supplied `source_id`.

```python
# Module-level — not on the controller class
_source_id_override: ContextVar[UUID | None] = ContextVar(
    "_source_id_override", default=None
)
_aabb_source_id_override: ContextVar[UUID | None] = ContextVar(
    "_aabb_source_id_override", default=None
)
```

Two separate vars exist — one for dims and appearance mutations, one for AABB mutations
— so that concurrent mutations to different sub-objects do not interfere with each
other's source attribution.

The three controller methods that use this pattern:

```python
def update_slice_indices(
    self, scene_id, slice_indices, *, source_id=None
) -> None:
    token = _source_id_override.set(source_id)
    try:
        self._model.scenes[scene_id].dims.selection.slice_indices = slice_indices
        # ↑ psygnal fires _on_dims_psygnal synchronously here
    finally:
        _source_id_override.reset(token)   # always restored, even on exception


def update_appearance_field(
    self, visual_id, field, value, *, source_id=None
) -> None:
    visual = self.get_visual_model(visual_id)
    token = _source_id_override.set(source_id)
    try:
        setattr(visual.appearance, field, value)
        # ↑ psygnal fires _on_appearance_psygnal synchronously here
    finally:
        _source_id_override.reset(token)


def update_aabb_field(
    self, visual_id, field, value, *, source_id=None
) -> None:
    visual = self.get_visual_model(visual_id)
    token = _aabb_source_id_override.set(source_id)
    try:
        setattr(visual.aabb, field, value)
        # ↑ psygnal fires _on_aabb_psygnal synchronously here
    finally:
        _aabb_source_id_override.reset(token)
```

Each bridge handler reads the var before emitting:

```python
# Inside _on_appearance_psygnal (returned by _make_appearance_handler)
resolved_source_id = _source_id_override.get() or self._id
self._event_bus.emit(
    AppearanceChangedEvent(source_id=resolved_source_id, ...)
)
```

If a model field is mutated directly — bypassing the controller methods — the ContextVar
is `None` and `source_id` falls back to the controller's own ID. No widget will
echo-filter such an event, which is the correct behaviour: the change looks external
to all subscribers.

### Why ContextVar rather than a plain instance variable

`ContextVar` is semantically correct for async code: each `asyncio.Task` has its own
copy of the context, so concurrent async mutations cannot stomp each other's
`source_id`. A plain `self._pending_source_id` instance variable would also work in
practice because psygnal fires synchronously (the bridge handler always runs and
completes before `set()` returns, so there is no race in a single-threaded async loop),
but `ContextVar` is the more principled choice and matches the intended use case.

### Full echo-filtering example

```python
class QtDimsSliders:
    changed: Signal = Signal(object)
    closed: Signal = Signal()

    def __init__(self, scene_id, ...):
        self._id = uuid4()
        self._scene_id = scene_id
        # No controller reference — wired externally via connect_widget.

    def subscription_specs(self) -> list[SubscriptionSpec]:
        return [SubscriptionSpec(
            event_type=DimsChangedEvent,
            handler=self._on_dims_changed,
            entity_id=self._scene_id,
        )]

    def _on_dims_changed(self, event: DimsChangedEvent) -> None:
        if event.source_id == self._id:
            return  # echo from our own slider move; ignore
        for axis, sld in self._sliders.items():
            value = event.dims_state.selection.slice_indices.get(axis)
            if value is not None:
                self._set_value(axis, value)   # uses blockSignals internally

    def _submit_slider_values(self) -> None:
        updates = {axis: sld.value() for axis, sld in self._sliders.items()
                   if axis not in self._displayed_axes}
        # Emit on changed; connect_widget has wired this to _incoming_events.emit.
        self.changed.emit(DimsUpdateEvent(
            source_id=self._id,
            scene_id=self._scene_id,
            slice_indices=updates,
            displayed_axes=None,
        ))
```

Both guards are necessary and serve different roles:

- **`source_id` check** — prevents the originating widget from processing its own
  echo (redundant work, since the model already reflects the new value).
- **`blockSignals`** — prevents a programmatically updated widget from re-broadcasting
  the change into the system. Without it, widget B being updated in response to
  widget A's change would fire widget B's `valueChanged`, triggering another
  `update_slice_indices`, producing another bus event, updating widget A — an
  infinite loop. `blockSignals` is the guard that breaks that cycle.

---

## Async handler convention

The bus dispatches synchronously. Handlers that need to await async work must call
`asyncio.create_task()` and return immediately. Awaiting directly inside a handler will
deadlock the Qt event loop.

This convention is **mandatory** for any handler that touches the slicer pipeline. It
is documented in every such handler's docstring.

```python
class SliceCoordinator:

    def _on_dims_changed(self, event: DimsChangedEvent) -> None:
        """Synchronous entry point — invalidates stale caches."""
        # Synchronous work only. Any async submission is the controller's
        # responsibility via reslice_scene().
        ...
```

---

## How the controller bridges psygnal to the bus

The controller is the only place where psygnal models and the EventBus coexist. When a
psygnal field event fires on a model — e.g. `visual.appearance.clim = (0.0, 1.0)`
triggers `appearance.events.clim.emit(...)` — the controller converts it into a typed
bus event and calls `bus.emit()`.

This bridging is done by private factory methods on the controller. Each factory
captures an entity ID by value and returns a closure that psygnal calls. The factory
pattern is required because Python loop closures bind by reference — without it, all
handlers wired in a loop would share the last iteration's variable.

### Reading the new value from `EmissionInfo`

The bridge handlers read the new field value from `info.args[0]`, which psygnal
populates with the emitted value. They do not call `Signal.current_emitter()` or
re-read from the model object.

```python
def _make_appearance_handler(self, visual_id: UUID) -> Callable:
    def _on_appearance_psygnal(info: EmissionInfo) -> None:
        field_name: str = info.signal.name
        new_value = info.args[0]            # new value from psygnal args
        resolved_source_id = _source_id_override.get() or self._id
        if field_name == "visible":
            self._event_bus.emit(VisualVisibilityChangedEvent(
                source_id=resolved_source_id,
                visual_id=visual_id,
                visible=new_value,
            ))
        else:
            self._event_bus.emit(AppearanceChangedEvent(
                source_id=resolved_source_id,
                visual_id=visual_id,
                field_name=field_name,
                new_value=new_value,
                requires_reslice=(field_name in _RESLICE_FIELDS),
            ))
    return _on_appearance_psygnal
```

### Handler storage for teardown

The controller stores every psygnal bridge handler it connects so that they can be
explicitly disconnected during visual teardown.  psygnal's `disconnect()` requires
the exact handler object — closures are not equality-comparable by value, so the
reference must be retained.

```python
# On the controller instance
self._visual_psygnal_handlers: dict[UUID, list[tuple]] = {}
# Each value is a list of (signal, handler) pairs — one per _wire_* call.
```

The `(signal, handler)` pair form is used rather than storing the handler alone so
that teardown can call `signal.disconnect(handler)` without branching on visual type.
Handlers are appended in wiring order:

| Visual type | Wired signals (in order) |
|---|---|
| `MultiscaleImageVisual` | `appearance.events`, `aabb.events`, `events.transform` |
| `ImageVisual` | `appearance.events`, `aabb.events`, `events.transform` |
| `MeshVisual`, `PointsVisual`, `LinesVisual` | `appearance.events`, `events.transform` |

Each `_wire_*` method creates the handler, connects it, and appends the pair:

```python
def _wire_appearance(self, visual) -> None:
    handler = self._make_appearance_handler(visual.id)
    visual.appearance.events.connect(handler)
    self._visual_psygnal_handlers.setdefault(visual.id, []).append(
        (visual.appearance.events, handler)
    )
```

### DimsManager wiring

The dims bridge reads the full state from the model rather than from `EmissionInfo`,
because `DimsState` is a composite snapshot of the entire `DimsManager` — not a single
field value.

```python
def _wire_dims_model(self, scene: Scene) -> None:
    self._dims_cache[scene.id] = scene.dims.selection.displayed_axes
    scene.dims.events.connect(self._make_dims_handler(scene.id))

def _make_dims_handler(self, scene_id: UUID) -> Callable:
    def _on_dims_psygnal(info: EmissionInfo) -> None:
        new_state = self._model.scenes[scene_id].dims.to_state()
        prev_axes = self._dims_cache[scene_id]
        displayed_axes_changed = prev_axes != new_state.selection.displayed_axes
        self._dims_cache[scene_id] = new_state.selection.displayed_axes
        if displayed_axes_changed:
            self._rebuild_visuals_geometry(scene_id, new_state.selection.displayed_axes)
            self._switch_canvas_cameras(scene_id, new_state.selection.displayed_axes)
        resolved_source_id = _source_id_override.get() or self._id
        self._event_bus.emit(DimsChangedEvent(
            source_id=resolved_source_id,
            scene_id=scene_id,
            dims_state=new_state,
            displayed_axes_changed=displayed_axes_changed,
        ))
    return _on_dims_psygnal
```

Note that `_rebuild_visuals_geometry` and `_switch_canvas_cameras` are called
synchronously inside the bridge handler, before the bus event is emitted. Camera
switching and visual geometry rebuilding happen as a direct consequence of the dims
change, not through bus subscriptions.

### AABB wiring

```python
def _wire_aabb(self, visual: MultiscaleImageVisual | ImageVisual) -> None:
    visual.aabb.events.connect(self._make_aabb_handler(visual.id))

def _make_aabb_handler(self, visual_id: UUID) -> Callable:
    def _on_aabb_psygnal(info: EmissionInfo) -> None:
        field_name: str = info.signal.name
        new_value = info.args[0]
        resolved_source_id = _aabb_source_id_override.get() or self._id
        self._event_bus.emit(AABBChangedEvent(
            source_id=resolved_source_id,
            visual_id=visual_id,
            field_name=field_name,
            new_value=new_value,
        ))
    return _on_aabb_psygnal
```

### Transform wiring

Transform changes do not use the ContextVar pattern because transforms are not driven
by GUI sliders — they come from application code via `set_visual_transform`. The
`source_id` is always the controller's own ID.

```python
def _make_transform_handler(self, visual_id: UUID, scene_id: UUID) -> Callable:
    def _on_transform(new_transform: AffineTransform) -> None:
        self._event_bus.emit(TransformChangedEvent(
            source_id=self._id,
            scene_id=scene_id,
            visual_id=visual_id,
            transform=new_transform,
        ))
        if not self._suppress_reslice:
            self.reslice_scene(scene_id)
    return _on_transform
```

---

## Registration and deregistration lifecycle

Every render-layer object passes its own ID as `owner_id` when subscribing. When the
controller removes an entity, it calls `bus.unsubscribe_all(entity_id)` to clean up
all subscriptions registered by that entity atomically.

```python
# Controller: wiring a new GFX visual
bus.subscribe(
    AppearanceChangedEvent,
    gfx_visual.on_appearance_changed,
    entity_id=visual_id,
    owner_id=visual_id,
)
bus.subscribe(
    AABBChangedEvent,
    gfx_visual.on_aabb_changed,
    entity_id=visual_id,
    owner_id=visual_id,
)
bus.subscribe(
    VisualVisibilityChangedEvent,
    gfx_visual.on_visibility_changed,
    entity_id=visual_id,
    owner_id=visual_id,
)
bus.subscribe(
    TransformChangedEvent,
    gfx_visual.on_transform_changed,
    entity_id=visual_id,
    owner_id=visual_id,
)

# Controller: removing the visual
bus.unsubscribe_all(owner_id=visual_id)  # removes all four in one call
```

### Visual teardown sequence

A visual has two independent sets of subscriptions that must both be cleaned up:

1. **psygnal side** — the bridge closures stored in `_visual_psygnal_handlers`.
   These live on psygnal `EventedModel` signals (`appearance.events`,
   `aabb.events`, `events.transform`) and are disconnected by calling
   `signal.disconnect(handler)` for each stored `(signal, handler)` pair.

2. **bus side** — the GFX-layer subscriptions registered with `owner_id=visual_id`
   (appearance, AABB, visibility, transform handlers on `GFX*Visual`).
   Removed atomically with `bus.unsubscribe_all(visual_id)`.

The teardown order inside `remove_visual` is:

```
1. scene.visuals.remove(visual_model)          # model layer
2. signal.disconnect(handler) for each pair    # psygnal bridge: stop emitting events
3. bus.unsubscribe_all(visual_id)              # bus: stop receiving events in GFX layer
4. _visual_to_scene.pop(visual_id)             # controller map
5. render_manager.remove_visual(visual_id)     # scene graph + GPU ref release
6. bus.emit(VisualRemovedEvent(...))            # notify external observers
```

Psygnal is disconnected **before** the bus so that no new bus events can be emitted
from stale bridge closures during or after step 5.  The bus is unsubscribed before
render-layer removal so that the GFX handlers cannot fire on a node that is already
removed from the scene graph.

`remove_scene` cascades: it calls `remove_visual` for every child visual before
tearing down the scene-level maps, then delegates to
`render_manager.remove_scene(scene_id)` which drops references to the `gfx.Scene`
and all `CanvasView` objects (GC then reclaims GPU resources — pygfx has no
explicit destroy API).

External callbacks registered by the application developer receive the full event
object, not a stripped-down state payload:

```python
# Application code
handle = controller.on_dims_changed(scene_id, my_callback, owner_id=my_id)

# my_callback receives the full DimsChangedEvent:
def my_callback(event: DimsChangedEvent) -> None:
    print(event.source_id, event.dims_state.selection.displayed_axes)
```

---

## Subscription matrix

Canonical specification for what the controller wires at construction time or at
object registration time.

| Subscriber | Event type | `entity_id` filter | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SliceCoordinator` | `DimsChangedEvent` | *(none — all scenes)* | Invalidate stale 2D caches |
| Controller | `DimsChangedEvent` | *(none — all scenes)* | Call `reslice_scene` for the changed scene |
| Controller | `CameraChangedEvent` | *(none — all canvases)* | Update camera model; schedule debounced reslice |
| `GFX*Visual` | `AppearanceChangedEvent` | `visual_id` | Apply material / shader parameter |
| `GFX*Visual` | `AABBChangedEvent` | `visual_id` | Update bounding-box display |
| `GFX*Visual` | `VisualVisibilityChangedEvent` | `visual_id` | Show / hide scene-graph node |
| `GFX*Visual` | `TransformChangedEvent` | `visual_id` | Update scene-graph node matrix |
| External callback | `DimsChangedEvent` | `scene_id` | Fire `on_dims_changed` user callback |
| External callback | `CameraChangedEvent` | `scene_id` | Fire `on_camera_changed` user callback |
| External callback | `AppearanceChangedEvent` | `visual_id` | Fire `on_visual_changed` user callback |
| External callback | `AABBChangedEvent` | `visual_id` | Fire `on_aabb_changed` user callback |
| External callback | `ResliceStartedEvent` | `scene_id` | Fire `on_reslice_started` user callback |
| External callback | `ResliceCompletedEvent` | `visual_id` | Fire `on_reslice_completed` user callback |

`SliceCoordinator` and the controller subscribe without `entity_id` filters because
they manage all scenes centrally. Camera switching and visual geometry rebuilding on
dims changes happen synchronously inside the controller's psygnal bridge handler
(`_make_dims_handler`), not through bus subscriptions.

`CanvasView` is not a bus subscriber. It emits `CameraChangedEvent` (detected by
comparing a cached `CameraState` snapshot each frame) but does not subscribe to any
event type. The controller receives `CameraChangedEvent` and handles model sync and
reslice scheduling.

---

## End-to-end example: appearance change propagation

This example traces a single colormap change through the full system, starting from
a widget that follows the decoupled widget contract.

```
QtClimRangeSlider
      ↓  changed.emit(AppearanceUpdateEvent(source_id=slider._id, field="clim", ...))
controller._incoming_events   ← connect_widget wired slider.changed → this bus
      ↓
_on_appearance_update()       ← incoming bus subscriber; calls update_appearance_field
      ↓
update_appearance_field()     ← sets ContextVar; mutates visual.appearance.clim
      ↓
psygnal EventedModel          ← clim signal fires synchronously
      ↓
Controller bridge             ← reads ContextVar; emits AppearanceChangedEvent
      ↓
EventBus.emit()               ← dispatches to subscribers
      ↙ requires_reslice=False          requires_reslice=True ↘
GFX*Visual                   Controller
on_appearance_changed()       reslice_scene() → RenderManager
      ↓                                ↓
pygfx renderer               AsyncSlicer
deferred GPU upload           concurrent brick reads
```

### The trigger

The slider emits its `changed` signal with an `AppearanceUpdateEvent` payload.
`connect_widget` has already wired `slider.changed → controller._incoming_events.emit`,
so the event enters the controller's incoming pipeline without any direct controller
call in widget code:

```python
# Inside QtClimRangeSlider._on_slider_changed — no controller import required:
self.changed.emit(
    AppearanceUpdateEvent(
        source_id=self._id,
        visual_id=self._visual_id,
        field="clim",
        value=value,
    )
)
```

### Stage 1 — Incoming bus dispatches to `_on_appearance_update`; model is mutated

`_on_appearance_update` receives the `AppearanceUpdateEvent` and forwards it to
`update_appearance_field`, preserving `source_id`:

```python
def _on_appearance_update(self, event: AppearanceUpdateEvent) -> None:
    self.update_appearance_field(
        event.visual_id, event.field, event.value, source_id=event.source_id
    )
```

`update_appearance_field` sets `_source_id_override` to `slider._id`, then sets
`visual.appearance.clim = (0.0, 1.0)`. psygnal fires `_on_appearance_psygnal`
synchronously before `setattr` returns.

### Stage 2 — Bridge handler reads ContextVar and emits bus event

```python
def _on_appearance_psygnal(info: EmissionInfo) -> None:
    field_name = info.signal.name          # "clim"
    new_value = info.args[0]               # (0.0, 1.0)
    resolved_source_id = _source_id_override.get() or self._id  # widget._id
    self._event_bus.emit(AppearanceChangedEvent(
        source_id=resolved_source_id,
        visual_id=visual_id,
        field_name="clim",
        new_value=(0.0, 1.0),
        requires_reslice=False,
    ))
```

`_source_id_override` is reset by `update_appearance_field`'s `finally` block after
`setattr` returns.

### Stage 3 — EventBus dispatches to subscribers

`emit()` dispatches `AppearanceChangedEvent` to all matching subscriptions. Two fire:

1. `GFXMultiscaleImageVisual.on_appearance_changed` — registered with
   `entity_id=visual_id`
2. Any external `on_visual_changed` callback registered by the application

The widget that triggered the change also has a subscription to
`AppearanceChangedEvent`. It checks `if event.source_id == self._id: return` and
skips the event. `blockSignals` is not needed here — the widget is only reading
the event, not driving a Qt signal.

### Stage 4 — `GFXMultiscaleImageVisual.on_appearance_changed`

The render-layer handler updates the pygfx material directly. No async work is
initiated — that is the controller's responsibility for `requires_reslice=True` fields.

### Stage 5 — pygfx deferred GPU upload

On the next call to `renderer.render()` in `CanvasView._draw_frame`, pygfx detects the
dirty material and uploads the updated parameters to the GPU.

### The reslice path: `lod_bias`, `force_level`, `frustum_cull`

When a field in `_RESLICE_FIELDS` changes, `AppearanceChangedEvent` carries
`requires_reslice=True`. The `GFX*Visual` handler does nothing for these fields. The
controller's `_on_dims_changed_bus` analogue for appearance changes triggers a reslice.
The updated field value is read from the live model at planning time — the event payload
itself does not need to carry planning parameters.

---

## What does not flow through the bus

- **Data payloads.** Brick data from `AsyncSlicer` is delivered directly to
  `GFX*Visual.on_data_ready()` via the `callback` argument to `slicer.submit()`.
  Only the lifecycle signal (`ResliceCompletedEvent`) goes through the bus.
- **Structural add/remove operations.** `add_visual()`, `remove_visual()`, etc. are
  synchronous and handled atomically by the controller. `VisualAddedEvent` and
  `VisualRemovedEvent` are emitted *after* the operation completes, for external
  observers such as a layer list widget.
- **Frame render loop.** The pygfx render loop runs via rendercanvas. `CanvasView`
  emits `FrameRenderedEvent` from its draw callback, but the loop itself is not
  bus-driven.

## Pending

- **`MouseEvent` family.** To be designed once the interaction model for picking,
  selection, and annotation is specified. Will follow the same NamedTuple / `source_id`
  pattern. Likely types: `CanvasMouseClickEvent`, `VisualPickedEvent`,
  `SelectionChangedEvent`.
