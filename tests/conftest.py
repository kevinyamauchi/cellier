    """Close every ``CellierController`` and ``CanvasView`` a test creates.

    Both own resources Python refcounting does not reclaim, and neither is
    released by dropping the object:

    * A render canvas is a parentless widget owned by the GUI backend, so a
      test that simply drops its controller leaks the canvas, its
      ``WgpuRenderer``, and the whole graph they reach.  Left alone the leak is
      cumulative: every canvas any earlier test built stays live and keeps
      drawing (they are created ``update_mode="continuous"``), so a full run
      ends holding ~100 of them.  That both starves the later tests
      (``tests/render`` slows to a crawl on CI) and leaves torn-down widgets
      for the Qt event loop to trip over (the Windows access violation).
    * An ``ipywidgets.Widget`` -- which every anywidget control is -- registers
      itself in a **process-global** table at construction, and only
      ``Widget.close()`` removes it.  Unclosed, a full run ends holding several
      hundred, each keeping its traits and everything it subscribed to alive.
    * A ``CellierController`` owns an ``AsyncSlicer`` holding live
      ``asyncio.Task`` objects.  Dropped rather than closed, those tasks are
      finalised by the garbage collector at an arbitrary later moment, and
      pytest's ``unraisableexception`` plugin reports the resulting
      ``ResourceWarning`` / "coroutine was never awaited" against **whatever
      test happens to be running then** -- which is how an unrelated test
      starts failing because a different module grew.

    Controllers are closed first: ``CellierController.close`` cancels pending
    slices and closes the canvases it owns, so the canvas pass afterwards only
    has to catch canvases built without a controller.  Widgets go last, because
    a cellier widget's ``close`` emits ``closed`` for the controller to act on.
    All three ``close`` methods are safe to call twice.
