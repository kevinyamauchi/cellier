"""Hiding a visual, end to end through the render stack.

Reported repeatedly against ``geometry_viewer_marimo.py`` and
``multiscale_image_viewer.py``, on **both** toolkits and for every visual
type: unchecking ``Visible`` appears to do nothing, and afterwards the canvas
seems frozen -- until you drag the camera, at which point the visual
disappears.

The model, the bus, the pygfx node and the redraw were all correct, and the
tests here cover that. The defect was one layer further down, in
``CanvasView``'s ``TemporalAccumulationPass``: it blends each frame into a
history texture whose ``reset()`` was called from exactly one place, guarded
by "did the camera move". A content change left the history in place, so the
hidden visual lingered as a ghost -- and dragging the camera cleared it, which
is what made this look like a redraw bug. Fixed by
``CanvasView.invalidate_accumulation``; see
``plans/temporal_accumulation_fix.md``.

**Read the paths these tests use carefully.** ``render_scene`` builds a
*fresh* offscreen renderer per call, with no effect passes and no history, so
it can prove the scene graph is right and is structurally **incapable** of
observing the accumulation bug. Two earlier versions of this module claimed
more than that setup could show. The tests that speak to the real defect are
the two at the bottom, which assert against ``CanvasView``'s own pass.
