"""A pick on a label's surface names the voxel that was drawn.

The label volume shader reports the surface as the *exact* crossing of the
face between the background cell and the foreground one.  That value sits on a
voxel boundary, and the 14-bit pick encode truncates, so without a correction
the decoded coordinate falls a fraction short and ``floor`` names the
background cell in front of the surface instead of the cell that was hit.

It only shows on the axis whose face the ray entered through, and only on that
axis's *low* face -- a downward bias at an upper boundary stays inside the same
voxel.  So it is invisible from three of six directions, which is why it
survived until someone clicked the edge of a small cube.  Reverting the shader
fix fails exactly the three low-face views here, in both render modes, which is
what makes that claim checkable rather than asserted.
