"""Tests for adding cellier's extra render targets after the first draw.

The targets are chosen at canvas construction from the render config, which
is right for a viewer configured up front and wrong for one where a user
ticks the box later.  ``ensure_extra_targets`` closes that gap by installing
a replacement blender mid-session; these tests pin the three things that
makes true and the one invariant it rests on.

Why this is safe, in the order the tests check it:

* The "must run before the first draw" rule belongs to
  ``enable_pick_texture_binding``, which raises usage bits on textures that
  already exist.  A replacement blender has no textures yet, so its own are
  created at the right size and usage on the next draw.
* pygfx keys its pipeline containers on ``(wobject, renderstate, material)``
  with the renderstate derived from ``Blender.hash``, so a new blender
  *branches* the pipeline cache rather than corrupting it.  The cost is one
  recompile frame.
* Both cellier effect passes re-resolve their optional target views every
  frame and fold presence into their pipeline hash, so they pick up a target
  that appears without being told.  **A pass that cached a view across
  frames would keep drawing into the abandoned blender**;
  ``test_a_swap_is_invisible_to_the_colour_output`` is what would catch that.
