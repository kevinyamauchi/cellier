"""A 3D labels surface pick reads the label it landed on, on every face.

B12: the pick buffer holds each axis in 14 bits and truncates, so a hit on a
voxel face (the bisected crossing of a background cell and a label cell) came
back up to ``dim / 16383`` voxels low.  On a low face that is outside the
label, and the consumer's ``floor`` read the background cell in front of the
surface; on a high face it landed inside by luck.  The brick shader now steps
a little way along the ray before encoding.

The block's six faces are all hit from the eight octant directions, and every
pick must decode to a voxel that holds the label.  Level 0 is forced, so the
drawn surface is the level-0 one the controller reads.

Only the multiscale (brick) shader is covered.  The in-memory labels shader
has its own step along the ray (``label_volume.wgsl``) and still reads
background on about 0.3% of edge hits in this test (a ray grazing a block
edge); that is not part of B12's face bug and is left out.
