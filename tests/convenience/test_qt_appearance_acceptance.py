"""Visual acceptance of the Qt appearance dock.

Stage 0 section 6.3 of ``plans/convenience_cleanup.md``: pins the group titles
the Qt appearance dock renders, in order, and that the panel actually paints.

**Stage 1 landed here**: the "Bounding box" group is new in every list below.
``QtAABBWidget`` already existed and the anywidget path already built one; only
the Qt renderer did not, which was drift rather than a toolkit limit
(section 7.1).  That change is the diff this module exists to show.
