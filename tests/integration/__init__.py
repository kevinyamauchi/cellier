"""Cross-layer integration tests for the ``transform_v2`` migration.

This directory is deliberately cross-layer: its suites drive a model, a
data store and a render-layer visual together, so none of the layer-scoped
test directories (``render``, ``gui``, ``visuals``, ``v2``) fits.  Same
reasoning that put ``tests/transform_v2/`` at the top level.

The golden baseline recorded here (``baseline/*.json`` +
``test_golden_baseline.py``) is a replayable snapshot of what every
drivable render-layer visual family produces *today* -- a node matrix and
a tuple of datastore selections -- for a parameterised matrix of
transforms and dims states.  Phases 3-6 of
``plans/world_space_slicing/transform_integration_implementation.md`` each
assert against it, which is what turns "did I break the renderer" from a
judgement call into an exit code.
