"""Replay the golden baseline against the current tree.

This suite is the regression net that Phases 3-6 of
``plans/world_space_slicing/transform_integration_implementation.md`` gate
against.  It re-drives every ``(family, transform, dims)`` cell of the
matrix in :mod:`tests.integration._harness` and asserts the node matrix
and the datastore selections are byte-for-byte what
``baseline/<family>.json`` recorded.

**It must pass on the unmodified tree.**  The JSON stores what the code
produces *today* -- not what the design predicts.  When a later phase
deliberately changes one of the three behaviours design section 3.6
names (``_harness.XFAIL_GROUPS``), the affected cases here start failing;
that phase re-records the JSON for exactly those cases and notes the flip
in its readout.  ``test_known_behaviour_changes_are_registered`` keeps the
list of those cases visible so the flip is never silent.
