"""An appearance change must ask the canvas for a frame.

Found by a user running ``examples/convenience/geometry_viewer_marimo.py``:
the ``visible`` checkbox appeared dead while every control next to it worked.
The model, the bus and the pygfx node were all correct -- ``node.visible``
really did become ``False``, and an offscreen render of the scene really did
change.  What did not happen was a **repaint**.

Nothing in the appearance path asked for one.  A reslice does, but only the
three ``_RESLICE_FIELDS`` trigger a reslice; every other appearance change
repaints the same data.  Fields that write a pygfx *material* tend to get a
frame anyway, because the dirtied resource reaches the canvas on its own --
which is why ``size``, ``color`` and the graph's ``node_visible`` looked fine.
``visible`` and ``aabb.enabled`` set plain scene-graph flags and got nothing,
so they were the two controls that looked broken.
